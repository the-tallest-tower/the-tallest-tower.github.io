Welcome to the development blog for The Tallest Tower!
 
Over the last few years, I've been doing some thinking about stories and conversation in games. I have a lot of thoughts about a particular kind of game I'd like to see made, and how story can be entwined into the experience in interesting ways. When I look around, I see the occasional game with bits and pieces of what I'd like in this hypothetical game. But no game yet has captured the entirety of what I have in mind.

So, I'm going to make it.

Currently I have the basics of an engine and the first parts of the game up and running. It's only a simple prototype at this
stage, but that will change as the game grows and evolves over the coming years.

The name "The Tallest Tower" will change before the game is done, but I need some sort of working title. No guarantee of any towers appearing in the final game, tall or otherwise.

In any case, welcome. I'm glad you're along for the ride.
